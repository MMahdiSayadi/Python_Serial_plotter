# Serial Plotter for FFT IP CORE
------------------------------------------------------
This is a example code to get data from FPGA and then show the
10*log10(16 bit data with 15 bits of fraction).  
If you want to test this software without FPGA,    
Follow these steps:    
1- Download ["virtual Serial com Driver by Eltima Sofware"](https://github.com/mealadmmb).  
2- After installation you should make two virtual com ports.  
3- After making two virtual comports connected together you should open both python files provided in this repository.  
4- Define the serial port settings in both python files,You should specify first comport in the test_serial_plotter.py file and buadrates,.... and Define the serial port settings in the Serial_Plotter.py.  
5- Test and enjoy.
